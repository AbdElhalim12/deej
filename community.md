# Community showcase

This is a showcase of `deej` versions built by people around the world. If you built yourself one of these things, I'd love to [add yours](mailto:omri.harel.en@gmail.com)! Either open a PR or contact me.

This build features a very neat 3D-printed enclosure to fit the sliders, and uses an Arduino Nano board.
